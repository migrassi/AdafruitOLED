## Install Arduino Libraries
Using these OLEDs with Arduino sketches requires that two libraries be installed: Adafruit_SSD1306, which handles the low-level communication with the hardware, and Adafruit_GFX, which builds atop this to add graphics and high level text functions.

Open up the Arduino library manager:

Search for the Adafruit SSD1306 library and install it

Search for the Adafruit GFX library and install it
